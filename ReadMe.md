# TaskDelegationManager

This project includes an ASP NET Core framework. For front end, I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. For backend, I use C# for my server and SQL Server for my database. 

Entity framework is used to set up the objects to match my database. The scripts for the database creation are included in this repo as well

For some background, this is the same tech stack I am using for my professional project that I have been working on the last few months. This project is much smaller in comparison, but it will still reflect the skills from the professional project.

I am using authentication and password hashing to avoid putting passwords as plain text in the database. Addtionally, I have certain permissions set to certain accounts, this way only certain accounts can perform certain actions. I will update this file when I have a more clear idea of what those permissions are and what they entail.

The goal of this project is to have somebody with higher authority give tasks to "memebers" of the site. They can track the tasks and update their progress of the tasks. I plan to include a calender view on the site to easily view the tasks for the day/week/month and maybe even download a csv/excel file for all of the user's tasks. 

I plan to include a comment/ thread portion for each task as well. 

Later down the line, maybe come up with an award system for completing tasks, could even be something as simple as awarding points
